# DietPlanners

Diet Planners is a tool that helps users to track and plan their weight loss journey. Users can enter their current informtation- weight, height, age- and then set a target goal for themselves. DietPlanner will help them keep track of their progress with daily check ins and a calorie counter based on the foods they ate and the amount of exercise they did. 


## Strategy and Tools

### Source Control and Review

Given the nature of large scale, multi-person projects, to best manage the various contributions of each member we will be using a combination of Git and GitHub, as well as their VCS integration into the common place IDEs used such as Eclipse and IntelliJ. This allows individuals to work on the project concurrently, each completing their own tasks and then pushing the changes to the master branch when complete. 

The tool used for code review for this project is called Codacy and is offered on the GitHub Marketplace. This web-app’s dashboard offer a thorough breakdown of the project’s existing issues such as code complexity, duplication, performance, code style, and much more. The dashboard also gives us important statistics based on the code’s quality over time. Furthermore, each commit is analyzed and can notify the reviewer if there are any problems with the code. Another feature that Codacy offers is anti-pattern detection. The admin can select known anti-patterns from a list for the automated code reviewer to detect.

### Tools

 Travis CI is a hosted, distributed continuous integration service used to build and test software projects. Travis CI can sync easily with GitHub projects and allows you to test your code quickly, as well as at no charge for open source projects. 
We chose to use Travus CI as the major build tool for our application, besides its various benefits, it is also the tool that our team was most familiar with. 

Furthermore, since we are a relatviely large group, finding a way to keep in contact and make sure every team member is up to date with all changes, we decided to use google drive and slack. Google drive is a useful tool which we will use to share and gather all important files, and for all of the documentation aspects of the project, Google Docs will be used and the files saved on our drive. 

The Slack application will help us communicate efficiently within various channels that will represent the different denominations of the team. Each subteam will have their own Slack channel in order for the team to stay organized and on track with the various tasks.
